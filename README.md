## Overview
This repository hosts the implementation of an **explainable deep learning model** (SincPD) for **Parkinson’s Disease (PD) diagnosis** and **severity estimation** through **gait cycle analysis**. Leveraging **SincNet filters** as adaptive bandpass filters, our approach extracts key frequency features from vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) signals. Such a design promotes better interpretability compared to conventional deep neural networks.

## Key Contributions
- **Adaptive Sinc Filters:** Extract important frequency components from raw vGRF signals.
- **Explainable AI:** Pruning filters with clustering techniques (K-means + silhouette scores) to highlight significant frequency bands.
- **PD Diagnosis & Severity Estimation:** Achieves high accuracy for both classification and severity levels.
- **Preprocessing & Optimization:** Removes noise from signals and prunes redundant filters to enhance efficiency and interpretability.

## Model Architecture
1. **Preprocessing:** Standardization and segmentation of gait cycle signals.  
2. **Feature Extraction:** SincNet layers learn adaptive bandpass filters specific to PD vs. healthy signals.  
3. **Pruning & Optimization:** Clustering-based approach to prune filters, ensuring a concise and interpretable model.  
4. **Classification:** Final fully connected layers classify PD presence and severity.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study is from [PhysioNet's Gait Database](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/).

## Performance
- **98.77% accuracy** for PD vs. healthy classification.
- **97.22% accuracy** for PD severity prediction.
